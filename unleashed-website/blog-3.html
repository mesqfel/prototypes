        <p>If you have a reactive dog — one that barks, lunges, or shuts down around other dogs — the idea of group socialisation probably sounds like a nightmare. But here's the counterintuitive truth: structured social sessions, done correctly, are one of the most powerful tools for helping reactive dogs become confident, calm companions.</p>
        <p>The key word is structured. This isn't a dog park free-for-all. It's a carefully managed environment where every interaction is intentional.</p>

        <h2>What makes a session "structured"?</h2>
        <p>At Unleashed, our Structured Social Sessions are built on a few core principles that separate them from casual dog park visits:</p>
        <p>Controlled introductions. Dogs don't just get thrown together. Each dog is assessed individually, and pairings are made based on energy levels, temperament, and current emotional state. A nervous border collie isn't paired with a high-energy boxer on their first session.</p>
        <p>Trainer-led activities. Every session has a purpose. We cycle through group obedience, impulse control exercises, parallel walking, and guided play. This gives dogs a job to focus on rather than fixating on each other.</p>
        <p>Clear boundaries and rest periods. Dogs get regular breaks. Arousal levels are monitored constantly, and any dog showing signs of stress or over-excitement is calmly removed for a reset. This prevents the emotional flooding that happens at chaotic dog parks.</p>

        <h2>Why this works for reactive dogs</h2>
        <p>Reactivity is almost always rooted in one of two emotions: fear or frustration. A reactive dog isn't "bad" or "aggressive" — they're overwhelmed and don't have the skills to cope with their emotional response.</p>
        <p>Structured social sessions work because they address the root cause:</p>
        <p>Predictability reduces anxiety. When a dog knows what to expect — arrival routine, warm-up, structured activities, cool-down — their nervous system can relax. Predictability is the antidote to anxiety.</p>
        <p>Positive associations build confidence. Every session is designed so that being around other dogs predicts good things: treats, play, swimming, praise. Over time, the dog's emotional response to other dogs shifts from "threat" to "opportunity."</p>
        <p>Gradual exposure builds tolerance. We start at a distance and intensity level where the reactive dog can succeed, then gradually increase the challenge. This is called systematic desensitisation, and it's the gold standard in behavioural modification.</p>

        <h2>What a typical session looks like</h2>
        <p>Our sessions run for about three hours and include pick-up and drop-off. A typical session might include: arrival and decompression walk, group obedience in a structured formation, impulse control games, free play in compatible groups, swimming and exploration, and a cool-down period before heading home.</p>
        <p>Dogs come home tired, calm, and fulfilled — not wired and overstimulated like they might after an unstructured dog park visit.</p>

        <h2>Real results</h2>
        <p>We've seen dogs go from lunging and barking at the sight of another dog to calmly walking in a group within weeks. Not because we suppressed their behaviour, but because we gave them the skills and confidence to handle social situations.</p>
        <p>The transformation isn't just visible in sessions — owners report calmer behaviour at home, better leash manners, and less anxiety in everyday situations. When a dog feels socially confident, it changes everything.</p>
        <p>If your dog struggles with reactivity, don't give up on socialisation. They just need the right kind — and that's what structured sessions are designed to provide.</p>
