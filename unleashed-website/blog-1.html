      <div class="article-container article__content">
        <p>For decades, dog training was built on the idea that dogs are constantly trying to dominate their owners. Be the alpha. Show them who's boss. Eat before your dog. Never let them on the furniture. The problem? Almost none of this is based on real science.</p>

        <h2>The myth of the alpha wolf</h2>
        <p>The dominance model came from studies of captive wolves in the 1940s. Researchers observed wolves competing aggressively for status and assumed this was natural pack behaviour. The original researcher, David Mech, later spent decades trying to correct this — wild wolf packs are actually family units led by parents, not by aggressive alphas fighting for rank.</p>
        <p>Applying wolf behaviour to domestic dogs was already flawed, but applying debunked wolf behaviour? That's a recipe for confusion, fear, and a damaged relationship between you and your dog.</p>

        <h2>What the science actually says</h2>
        <p>Modern animal behaviour research tells us that dogs learn through association and consequence — not through social hierarchies with humans. When your dog pulls on the leash, they're not trying to be the leader. They're excited, and pulling has worked before to get them where they want to go.</p>
        <p>When your dog jumps on visitors, they're not asserting dominance. They're seeking attention, and they've learned that jumping gets a reaction.</p>
        <p>Understanding this distinction matters because it changes how you respond. Instead of punishing unwanted behaviour (which often creates anxiety and confusion), you can redirect it and reinforce what you actually want.</p>

        <h2>What to do instead</h2>
        <p>At Unleashed, our approach is built on three principles grounded in behavioural science:</p>
        <p>Communication over correction. We teach you and your dog a shared language using conditioned markers — clear signals that tell your dog exactly what behaviour you're rewarding. This removes ambiguity and builds trust.</p>
        <p>Management over confrontation. Instead of waiting for your dog to fail and then correcting them, we set up environments where they're more likely to succeed. Prevention is more effective than punishment.</p>
        <p>Reinforcement over suppression. Behaviours that get reinforced get repeated. We focus on rewarding the behaviours you want to see more of, rather than trying to stamp out the ones you don't.</p>

        <h2>The result</h2>
        <p>Dogs trained with modern, science-based methods aren't just obedient — they're confident, resilient, and genuinely connected to their families. They don't comply out of fear. They cooperate because communication is clear and the relationship is built on trust.</p>
        <p>If you've tried dominance-based methods and felt like something wasn't right, you're not alone. There's a better way — and it starts with understanding how your dog actually thinks.</p>
