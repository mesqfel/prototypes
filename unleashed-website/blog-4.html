        <p>Board &amp; Train is the most immersive program we offer at Unleashed. Your dog stays with us overnight, receiving daily group sessions, personalised 1:1 training, enrichment activities, and constant trainer supervision. It's intensive, it's effective, and for many dogs, it's transformative.</p>
        <p>But it's also a big commitment — for your dog and for you. Here's everything you need to know to make the most of it.</p>

        <h2>Who is Board &amp; Train for?</h2>
        <p>Board &amp; Train is ideal for dogs that need concentrated, consistent work on specific behavioural challenges. This includes dogs with reactivity or fear issues that need daily exposure work, adolescent dogs going through behavioural regression, dogs that would benefit from a structured routine they're not getting at home, and families who want to fast-track foundational training.</p>
        <p>It's also a great option for owners with busy schedules who want their dog to get a strong foundation that can then be maintained at home with follow-up lessons.</p>

        <h2>What happens during the stay</h2>
        <p>Every day at Unleashed is structured with purpose. A typical day includes a morning decompression walk and environmental enrichment, a group social session with compatible dogs focusing on impulse control and emotional regulation, a 1:1 training session targeting your dog's specific goals, afternoon free play, swimming, or exploration, and an evening wind-down with calm activities and rest.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, your dog is supervised by experienced trainers who monitor body language, stress levels, and progress. We adjust the program in real-time based on how your dog is responding.</p>

        <h2>How to prepare your dog</h2>
        <p>To set your dog up for the best possible experience, we recommend a few things:</p>
        <p>Book a First Private Lesson first. We need to assess your dog's temperament, triggers, and current skill level before starting a Board &amp; Train program. This lesson also helps us understand your goals and expectations.</p>
        <p>Bring familiar items. A favourite blanket, toy, or something that smells like home can help ease the transition, especially for the first night.</p>
        <p>Share their routine. Let us know their feeding schedule, any medical needs, and behaviours we should be aware of. The more we know, the better we can support your dog.</p>
        <p>Prepare for the handover. For stays of 10 days or more, we include a private handover lesson where we teach you everything your dog has learned. This is critical — the training only sticks if you know how to maintain it at home.</p>

        <h2>What to expect when they come home</h2>
        <p>Most owners notice an immediate difference: calmer energy, better focus, improved responsiveness to cues. But it's important to set realistic expectations. Board &amp; Train isn't a magic fix — it's a powerful foundation.</p>
        <p>The first few days at home are a transition period. Your dog has been in a highly structured environment, and returning to their usual routine can be an adjustment. Stick to the techniques we teach you in the handover session, keep the structure consistent, and don't be afraid to reach out if you need support.</p>

        <h2>The Unleashed difference</h2>
        <p>What sets our Board &amp; Train apart is the combination of science-based methods, genuine care, and comprehensive owner education. We don't just train your dog and hand them back — we train your whole family so the results last a lifetime.</p>
        <p>Interested in Board &amp; Train for your dog? Start with a First Private Lesson and we'll build a tailored plan together.</p>
